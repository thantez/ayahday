# Ayah Day

## Introduction

Muslims have a holy book called the Qur'an, whose language is Arabic and its
Persian translation is available.

So, I had an idea to writing a program that would show me a verse from this
book with a translation and a `Tafsir` (Interpretation) in texts and audios,
every day when I turn on the computer.

## Description

This is a simple implementation. :))

## installation

### Use binary version

You can Install this for Windows or Linux by provided Installers in `release` section (right side).

or

### Build it manually

[install Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) and then clone this repo.

after that:

```bash
$ npm install
$ neu run
```

## TODO

* [ ] bug fix and exception handling
* [ ] documentation
* [ ] app will start when linux boots up
* [ ] install script
* [ ] Adding a setting/options page for customization
* [ ] Add a menu bar for more tools and a "Info" page.
