# Ayah Day

## Introduction

Muslims have a holy book called the Qur'an, whose language is Arabic and its
Persian translation is available.

So, I had an idea to writing a program that would show me a verse from this
book with a translation and a `Tafsir` (Interpretation) in texts and audios,
every day when I turn on the computer.

## Description

This is a simple implementation. :))
